# GC Ratio Calculator for BRCA1 Sequence üß¨

This is a simple Python script to calculate the GC content of the BRCA1 gene sequence downloaded from NCBI (in FASTA format).

## üîç Description

The GC content (percentage of guanine and cytosine bases) is a common metric in genomics and bioinformatics.  
This script analyzes the BRCA1 gene sequence to calculate its GC ratio using a `.fasta` file as input.

I created this project to practice Python skills while exploring real genetic data.
